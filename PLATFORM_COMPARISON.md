## Communication Fallback Scenarios

### Scenario 1: iOS Device with No HQ Connection

**Problem**: iOS device loses internet connection

**Impact**:
- Cannot send new markers or messages
- Real-time updates stop
- Login/authentication unavailable
- Gateway data unavailable

**Fallback**:
- View cached map at last position
- Browse previously loaded markers
- Read message history
- Queue new actions (sent when reconnected)

**Recovery**:
- Actions auto-sync when connection restored
- Latest data fetched from HQ
- Map and markers refreshed

---

### Scenario 2: Android Device with No Meshtastic

**Problem**: Android device has no Meshtastic device available

**Impact**:
- Cannot send/receive mesh messages directly
- No direct node discovery
- No offline mesh communication

**Fallback Option A** - Use HQ Gateway:
- Connect to HQ server via WiFi/cellular
- Send messages via REST API
- HQ gateway forwards to mesh
- Receive mesh updates via WebSocket

**Fallback Option B** - Standalone Mode:
- Use GPS and mapping features
- Create markers and waypoints
- Export data for later sync
- Operate as standalone GPS tracker

---

### Scenario 3: HQ Gateway Down

**Problem**: HQ's Meshtastic gateway is offline

**Impact on iOS**:
- ❌ No mesh network access
- ✅ REST API still works
- ✅ Map and markers functional
- ✅ User management works

**Impact on Android**:
- ✅ Direct mesh still works
- ⚠️ Cannot relay to HQ
- ✅ All native features work
- ✅ Full offline operation

**Recovery**:
- Restart gateway service
- Reconnect Meshtastic device
- Verify serial port/BLE connection

---

### Scenario 4: Mixed Platform Deployment

**Setup**: iOS devices at HQ, Android devices in field

**Communication Flow**:
```
Field (Android) → Meshtastic Mesh → HQ Gateway → REST API → HQ (iOS)
HQ (iOS) → REST API → HQ Gateway → Meshtastic Mesh → Field (Android)
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ HQ has reliable internet
- ✅ Field has offline mesh
- ✅ Best of both platforms
- ✅ Redundant communication paths

**Considerations**:
- Gateway must be reliable (single point of failure)
- Network latency adds delay
- HQ must maintain gateway service

---

### Scenario 5: Complete Network Failure

**Problem**: Both internet and mesh networks down

**iOS PWA**:
- ❌ Cannot function without any network
- ✅ Cached map viewing only
- ✅ Offline marker browsing
- ❌ No new data

**Android Native**:
- ✅ GPS tracking continues
- ✅ Marker creation works
- ✅ Local database functions
- ✅ Data queued for sync
- ⚠️ No external communication

**Recovery**:
- Restore internet or mesh network
- Data syncs automatically
- Merge any offline changes

---
